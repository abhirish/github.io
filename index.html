<p> This project primarily deals with creating libraries in VBA and R for quick automation. Excel and R though being powerful tools require
some level of customization for specific use. We find out the procedures that are used repetitively and build libraries to tackle them. Some functions in
the library can send email from excel in multiple formats, download and upload data based on custom query from excel, generating pdfs, matrix inversion.
These libraries were helpful to significantly reduce the time of automation. Some of the libraries can be found

<p>This project is used to report and strategize on hedge effectiveness. 
The primary tools for hedging interest rate risk are duration and convexity, 
the basic premise is if the market moves the underlying and derivative should move in opposite directions by the same amount for duration neutral trades. 
We create a decision support system which can extract data from multiple sources such as SQL, excel, PolyPaths, Bloomberg 
and can process .bat and .vbs files, analyze using user defined rules and send alerts. 
This system keeps tracks of all the accounts and can provide hedge ineffectiveness on a day to day basis, 
this information provides information on exposure on the term structure.
A more sophisticated version of this system can perform scenario testing.</p>

<p>This project deals with monitoring and projecting important ratios used as constraints while optimizing portfolio allocation. 
FHLB system is a GSE and has a mission to support member banks and promote housing market in their areas. 
The Federal Housing Board assigns a multiple constraints such as core mission asset ratio, excess capital stock regulation etc, 
hence the FHLB Banks have to maximize profits under these constraint. 
It is important to monitor and project these constraints under different scenarios for optimal portfolio allocation. 
We built a descision support system which calculate these ratios based on different methods and projects these ratios in different 
scenarios. This report is very critical to bank's rating and income.</p>

<p>Objective
This project deals with 1) estimating share and size of wallet of customers under incomplete information 2) Estimating targeting efforts using share and size of wallet jointly.

Data
37 months of transactional level data of 9,000 customer for one of the largest US credit card companies. For each account we were provided with
the account number, type of account, date and amount associated with each transaction. We also have the credit limit for each account, customer's 
occupation, reward card type. 140 transaction were made on each account over the 37 month period.  

Methodology
We use two methods 1) We assume the total number of transactions made by a customer modeled as a poisson process. Number of transations made 
at the focal firm is modeled as binomial distribution. Next we write the likelihood and estimate the parameters. 2) In the second method we model the interpurchase time as an erlang distribution and model the credit card usage as markov transition probabilities. Next we jointly write the likelihood and estimate the parameters for share and size of wallet. We find the second method to be more robust. Next we use the share and size of wallet to estimate the targeting efforts for each customer.

Results
We were successfully able to match our estimates with the survey data and eventually obtain the targeting efforts for each customer. This study is first of its kind which
helps to estimate the targeting efforts based on jointly using share and size of wallet. Specifically we find that out of 6282 active customers 1186 have high size of wallet but low share of wallet, hence the firm should use the highest targeting efforts for these customers</p>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/#mentioning-users-and-teams" class="user-mention">@mention</a> a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>
